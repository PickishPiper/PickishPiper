### Hi, I'm Liz Marchiondo!
<p> I'm a seasoned professional with quality assurance testing, customer service, photography, videograpy, and scuba experience. I am currently learning full stack development through SheCoes, LinkedIn Learning, Google certifications, and trial and error. I am interested in finding resources for daily or weekly coding challenges and my goal is to transition into a new career in coding. I have a strong affinity towards CSS and I want to create interactive sites and applications that have a strong and throughtful design focus. I currently work as a Lead Customer Service Representative for a nationally recognized photographic and video equipment rental company as well as a sales and IT specialist at a SCUBA instruction and showroom in Northern California.
